## Analysis Directory Preview 

Within `~/LArSMC/analysis` there is a directory for each wavelength to allow for wavelength-specific analysis, as well 
as `~/LArSMC/analysis/larsmc_all` for broad analysis.

The ring-based analysis starts within each of the wavelength-specific directories, while the grid-based analysis begins in `~/LArSMC/analysis/larsmc_all`.

Find the README file within `~/LArSMC/analysis/larsmc_128nm` for documentation that applies to *all* wavelength-specific directories. 
Find the README file within `~/LArSMC/analysis/larsmc_all` for documentation on the broad analysis.

**Note:** `~/LArSMC/analysis/larsmc_180nm_ref` is for analysis of simulation data that was ran with the cage beign reflective.

### BottomRingsPlot.C

This macro creates a visual of the bottom of the cage with rings to help visualize the ring-based analysis.
